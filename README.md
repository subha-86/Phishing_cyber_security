A phishing attack is a form of cyberattack that targets individuals or organizations with the intent of stealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. The attacker disguises themselves as a legitimate or trustworthy entity, such as a bank, social media platform, or government agency, in order to trick the victim into sharing confidential information.The most common method used in phishing is through a malicious URL. 

# Crafting a Fake Link (Malicious URL)
The attacker creates a website that looks nearly identical to a real, trusted site (like a bank login page or an email portal). A link to this fake website is embedded in an email, text message, or social media message. The URL may be slightly altered to appear real at first glance (e.g., www.paypa1.com instead of www.paypal.com).


# Victim Clicks the Link
When the victim clicks the link, they’re redirected to the phishing website, which looks real but is controlled by the attacker. The page asks the user to enter sensitive details such as login credentials, credit card info, or security answers.


# Harvesting the Data
Once the user submits their information, it is immediately captured by the attacker. The attacker can then use this information to:
- Log in to the victim’s real accounts
- Make unauthorized transactions
- Steal identities
- Launch further attacks

# Procedure:
To identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email, one should first obtain a sample email from a reliable source. The sender’s email address must be examined meticulously for signs of spoofing or domain inconsistencies. Subsequently, the email headers should be analyzed using an appropriate online tool to verify authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC; failure in these checks often indicates fraudulent activity. It is essential to inspect all embedded links by hovering to reveal their actual URLs, noting any discrepancies or suspicious domains, and to exercise caution when handling attachments. The language and tone of the email should be evaluated for urgency or threats intended to coerce immediate action. Additionally, attention must be paid to spelling and grammatical errors, which frequently occur in phishing communications. Finally, a comprehensive summary of identified phishing indicators should be prepared to assess potential risks and inform appropriate mitigation measures.
